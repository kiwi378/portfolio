            <p>The "Building Wealth for Future Leaders" event was part of my SULAM project during my degree, aimed at
                teaching financial management to young leaders through interactive activities and expert talks. It
                focused on budgeting, saving, and investing to help participants make smarter financial decisions.</p>

            <h2>My Role in the SULAM Project</h2>
            <p>I feel proud of my role as the Event Management Director for the SULAM project. I was responsible for
                planning a detailed timeline to ensure smooth transitions between activities, games, and breaks. I also
                oversaw the stage setup, managed technical aspects, and coordinated with performers to prepare for their
                performances. Additionally, I worked with other departments to arrange resources for activities and
                organized the event space with proper seating, signage, and activity areas.</p>

            <p>During the event, I managed the event flow, solved any logistical issues, and kept the audience engaged
                through lively hosting. I also arranged for an emcee, facilitated prayer sessions, and prepared weekly
                reports to monitor progress. A key moment for me was my presentation on individual budgeting tools,
                where
                I shared practical tips to help attendees manage their finances. Overall, this experience taught me
                valuable skills such as time management, teamwork, and communication. It was a rewarding opportunity to
                contribute to the success of the event and help future leaders gain financial knowledge.</p>
